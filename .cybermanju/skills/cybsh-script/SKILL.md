# `.cybsh` scripts — what to write

A `.cybsh` file is **interpreted automation over the same shell as the
Terminal** — no compiler, no build step. Run it with:

```bash
run /scripts/tidy.cybsh                              # execute
run /scripts/tidy.cybsh --dry                        # parse + budget-check only
run /scripts/tidy.cybsh --lint                       # style warnings only
run /scripts/tidy.cybsh --fmt                        # print canonical format
run /scripts/tidy.cybsh --json                       # machine output {path, vars, caps, calls, output}
run /scripts/tidy.cybsh --record nightly.json        # capture sh/fetch into a journal
run /scripts/tidy.cybsh --replay nightly.json        # replay journal, no network/exec
```

The file **must** end in `.cybsh` (otherwise `run` refuses with
`invalid:`). Same language on all three transports (native shell
`crates/os/src/script.rs`, Pages twin `src/utils/cybshScript.ts`, WASM
fallback in `crates/os-wasm/src/os.rs`). Runnable examples ship in
`examples/` — `tour.cybsh` covers almost everything below (start there;
copy the dir to `/scripts` to run them, since `tour` imports
`/scripts/lib.cybsh`).

Pin the language and declare least privilege up top (both optional,
both recommended):

```python
# cybsh: 1
# cap: net=api.example.com read=/archive write=/archive deny=rm,sync
```

- `# cybsh: 1` — language version. Missing = allowed (back-compat);
  wrong number = honest `unsupported:` (reproducibility starts here).
- `# cap:` — Deno-style capabilities (may repeat, merged). `deny=`
  refuses shell verbs, `net=` allowlists `fetch` hosts, `read=`/`write=`
  declare intent (audited in `--json`, enforced at the agent gate).
  Deny always wins. Anything refused fails as `denied:` — prefix-first,
  so UI hints keep working (`denied: … (line 4)`).

## Statements (one per line, `#` comments)

```python
# variables — `let`/`const` identical, optional TS types stripped
let name = "manju"
let retries: number = 3
const bucket = "/backups"
name = "manju-os"                      # reassign, no `let` needed

print "hello"                          # python-style
print("two", "args")                   # comma args join with spaces
print len("abcd"), 1 + 2               # expressions everywhere

if retries > 0:                        # trailing `:` required
  print "retrying"
elif retries == 0:                     # `elif`, not `else if`
  print "last chance"
else:
  print "done"

# explicit failure handling (Elvish over bash: abort unless caught HERE)
try:
  sh "sync start"
catch e:                               # `catch:` without binding also works
  print "warn: " + e

fail "stop the world"                  # raise `fail: …` (caught by `catch`)

for f in ["a", "b"]:                   # lists, range(3), strings, dict→keys
  print f
for i in range(3):
  print i

let n = 0
while n < 3:                           # bounded (1000 iters max)
  let n = n + 1

# functions — lexical scope, owned values, no global mutation
def greet(name, punct):
  return "hi " + name + punct          # bare `return` = null

print greet("manju", "!")

vars                                   # list live bindings
free name                              # drop one binding
gc                                     # release last-output `_` buffer, report
```

`def` rules: params bind as locals (shadowing allowed), globals stay
readable, assignments never escape; recursion bounded (call depth 32);
`return` outside `def` is a syntax error; builtin names
(`len/int/str/json/split/range/sh/set/push/del/keys/values`, literals,
`and/or/not`) cannot be redefined — one meaning per name.

## Match, await, import, with, pipes, inputs (one way each, Oils rule)

```python
match sh("sync status --json"):          # Rust-style Result: failing `sh`
  ok(st):                                # becomes the `err` arm, no abort
    print st.jobs
  err(e):
    print "sync unavailable: " + e
  else:                                  # `else:` catches anything left
    print "unexpected"

let it = ok("fine")                      # constructors + `?` unwrap
print it?                                # postfix `?` (err aborts w/ line N)
print unwrap(err("x"))                   # same, function form

await len(sh("sync status --json").jobs) == 0 timeout 30   # poll till truthy
# detached jobs (`sync start`, `ai ask`): `await` polls logically, no
# sleep — a still-falsy expr after N tries fails as `timeout:` (catchable)

import "/lib/util.cybsh" as u            # merge another file's `def`s only
print u_greet("manju")                   # (caps/frontmatter stay local;
                                         # `.cybsh` required, 4 deep max)

with tmp = sh("ls / --json"):            # scoped block: assignments inside
  print len(tmp)                         # never escape (RAII/Vue-scope rule)

print "a,b,c" |> split(",") |> len       # `x |> f(a)` is `f(x, a)` (Nushell)
print "hi" |> greet                      # user `def`s pipe too

print args                               # `run f.cybsh -- a b` binds argv
print arg(0, "weekly")                   # indexed + fallback
print env("HOME", "/")                   # host env (ambient, unjournaled)
```

## Values: text is UI, structure is API (Nushell rule)

`null true false` numbers strings lists **dicts** (sorted keys —
display, iteration and `==` are deterministic on every transport):

```python
let d = {"b": 2, "a": 1}              # or {b: 2} — bare idents work
print d                                # {"a": 1, "b": 2} — sorted, always
print d.a                              # 1 — field access
print d["b"]                           # 2 — key access
print [10, 20][1]                      # 20 — list index
print "xy"[1]                          # y — string char

let e = set(d, "c", 3)                 # functional updates (new values)
let l = push([1], 2)                   # [1, 2]
let s = del(e, "a")                    # {"b": 2, "c": 3}
print keys(e)                          # [a, b, c] — sorted
print values(e)                        # [1, 2, 3] — key order
for k in e:                            # dicts iterate sorted keys
  print k + "=" + str(e[k])
```

`+` concatenates with strings (`"n=" + 1`), `"ab" * 3` repeats;
`==` across types compares displays (Starlark-strict `<` stays
same-type); `len()` counts chars/items/keys; `int()/str()` convert.

## Inline shell — the point of the file (one way, Oils rule)

Any real cybsh verb works **bare** (same table as `help`), or explicitly.
All forms are the same call — pick one per script:

```bash
ls /                                   # bare line, output shown + kept in `_`
$ sync status                          # `$` prefix, same thing
sh "providers --json"                  # `sh` form (quote it)
let listing = sh("ls / --json")        # capture instead of printing
sh("echo " + name)                     # any expression as the command
```

`sh()` with `--json` output **materializes into structure** — no
re-parsing (Nushell rule):

```python
let st = sh("sync status --json")
print st.jobs                            # field access, no grep
let first = sh("ls / --json")
```

Inline lines support `&&`/`||`/`;` natively, `--json` for machine
parsing, and `${var}` interpolation. A failing line aborts as
`<cause> (line N)` — prefix-first, catchable:

```python
let dst = "/backups"
$ cp /report.pdf ${dst}/report.pdf
try:
  sh "sync start"
catch:
  sh "echo sync-offline"
```

Host files use the same verbs with `-os` (native shell only: sdcard on
Android, process cwd on desktop). `deny=<verb>` covers the `-os` variant
too (`deny=rm` refuses `rm -os`):

```python
try:
  let photos = sh("ls -os /sdcard/DCIM --json")
  sh("cp -os /sdcard/DCIM/shot.jpg /photos/shot.jpg")
catch e:
  # static/Pages has no host filesystem: `-os` answers `unsupported:`
  print "host unavailable here: " + e
```

Record once (`--record`) and `-os` output replays byte-identically
(`--replay`) on transports without a host — the journal bridges them.

## `js` expressions (subset, no engine needed)

```python
let x = js: 1 + 2 * 3                  # arithmetic, compare, and/or/not
js x > 5 and len(name) > 0             # statement form prints true/false
```

Supported: `+ - * / %`, `== != < <= > >=`, `and or not` (JS `&& || !`
`=== !==` normalized), parens, lists/dicts, `${var}` in strings,
`true/false/null`. `js` is **pure** — shell work needs `sh()`.

## `fetch`, providers, durability

```python
fetch "https://api.github.com/repos/o/r" as body   # static/Pages transport
print len(body)
```

- `fetch` **really runs on Pages/static** (10 s, 64 KiB, capability
  gated); the native Rust shells have no HTTP client and answer honest
  `unsupported:` — **unless replaying a journal** (below), which serves
  `fetch` deterministically everywhere.
- Providers/durability are just shell verbs — prefer them over `fetch`:
  `providers`, `quota`, `sync status|list|move <file> <from> <to>`, `disk`, `mount`,
  `scrub`, `repair`, `gc`, `lease status`, `compress [lz4|zstd|brotli|triple]|decompress`,
  `encrypt|decrypt|keygen`, `search|grep|find`.
- Provider files live at `/providers/<mountId>/…` — same `cp/mv/rm/mkdir`
  verbs, cross-provider moves copy-then-delete.

## Namespaces: volume, providers, host (touch/move files anywhere)

`ls /` shows the whole virtual drive in one view: the vault volume **plus**
a synthetic `providers/` entry for the provider namespace (a real volume
directory literally named `providers` wins, and the namespace shadows it).

```bash
ls /                                 # vault volume + providers/ (discovery)
ls /providers                        # every mount/config ( Drive, GitHub, GitLab )
ls /providers/<id>/docs              # files + folders, folders first
cat /providers/<id>/README.md        # 1 MiB print cap (cp to read fully)
cp /providers/<a>/f.md /notes.md     # provider → vault
cp /notes.md /providers/<b>/f.md     # vault → provider (BLAKE3-verified)
mv /providers/<a>/f /providers/<b>/g # copy → verify → delete source
sync move notes.txt <a> <b>          # move a *synced copy's* home provider
rm /providers/<id>/old.md            # rm -r for provider dirs
mkdir -p /providers/<id>/new/dir    # `.keep` marker (git has no empty dirs)
stat /providers/<id>/f.md [--json]
cd /providers/<id>/docs              # relative paths keep working after
```

The `-os` flag transposes the same file verbs onto the **host (device)
filesystem** — shared storage on Android (`/sdcard`), the process working
directory on desktop. Both operands of `cp -os`/`mv -os` are host paths;
in `-os` mode even a literal `/providers/…` is a host path.

```bash
ls -os                                # shared-storage root (sdcard on Android)
ls -os /sdcard/Download               # absolute or host-relative paths
cat -os /sdcard/a.txt                 # 1 MiB print cap, like provider reads
cp -os /sdcard/a.txt /vault-drop/a.txt
mv -os /sdcard/old.txt /sdcard/new.txt  # cross-filesystem = copy → verify → delete
rm -os /sdcard/tmp.txt                # rm -os -r for host dirs
mkdir -os -p /sdcard/new/dir
touch -os /sdcard/new/note.txt
stat -os /sdcard/a.txt [--json]
du -os /sdcard/Download [--json]
cd -os /sdcard/Music                  # moves the *host* cwd (volume cwd untouched)
pwd -os                               # show the host cwd
```

Host verbs are `ls/cd/pwd/cat/cp/mv/rm/mkdir/touch/stat/du/df` plus the
read verbs `find/grep/head/tail/wc` and `write` — any other verb with `-os`
refuses with `unsupported:` instead of touching the volume. Pure commands
and script wrappers agree on every transport: `sh("ls -os …")` / `$ ls -os`
go through the same shell choke point as the terminal line, so a script
sees the host listing natively and `unsupported:` anywhere else.
Host access is best-effort: a denied directory answers `not_found:` with
the OS reason (on Android, grant a folder via Setup → Providers → Local
folder when the sandbox withholds sdcard). The static/Pages build has no
host filesystem: `-os` there answers `unsupported:` on all three paths —
single-command lines, chained `&&`/`;` lines, and direct `wasm` dispatch —
replay a journal or run the line in the desktop/Android app.

For the AI agent: the `bash` tool runs these same cybsh verbs (cybsh-first
in `auto` mode), so touching or moving provider files or host files means
`bash` with the lines above — `read/list/write/edit/grep/glob` stay
volume-contained and refuse escapes. Prefer `--json` (`ls --json`,
`ls -os --json`, `stat --json`) and capture with `sh("… --json")` so the
listing materializes into structure instead of parsed text. Vault/secret
paths (`*.cybermanju`, `master.passphrase`, `keystore.json`) are never
synced or moved; one provider/disk holds the keys for the rest
(`SyncConfig.keyHolder` — set it on the provider card, not from a script).

## Replay journals — determinism you can file

Record once where the network lives, replay anywhere (Bazel rule:
same inputs → same outputs):

```bash
run /scripts/nightly.cybsh --record nightly.json     # on Pages/desktop
run /scripts/nightly.cybsh --replay nightly.json     # anywhere, offline
```

The journal captures every `sh` output and `fetch` body, fingerprinted
(FNV-1a/64) by script source. Replaying changed code is an `integrity:`
refusal, never a silent lie; a missing call is `not_found:`.

Declare schedule/trigger frontmatter (convention, first 200 lines —
`run --json` reports it; a missing `on:` defaults to manual):

```python
# schedule: nightly
# on: inbox, 02:00
# desc: tidy provider inbox, report, restyle
```

## OS interface — colours and theme

```bash
ui get                                 # show theme + accent
ui theme os-dark                        # 5 themes: os-dark|os-light|os-graphite
                                        # (flat set) + plasma-dark|plasma-light
                                        # (Breeze-like set)
ui accent #ff2d55                      # #rrggbb|#rgb, or `default` for system
theme plasma-dark                      # short form (theme only)
```

(Pre-remake ids like `mac-dark`/`nebula-night` still resolve — they
migrate by mode — but write the five canonical ids in new scripts.)

Every mutation prints a machine `ui: theme=…` / `ui: accent=…` line: the
Terminal applies it live via `useTheme()`, and it persists to the volume
mirror (`/.cybermanju/theme.json`) + `localStorage`. From scripts:

```python
sh "ui theme os-dark"
if "dark" == "dark":
  sh "ui accent #0a84ff"
```

## Memory model (why no GC tuning)

Values are **owned** — no aliasing, no tracing collector. Budgets bound
everything instead: 64 KiB source · 200 statements/block · 5000 steps ·
1000 loop iters · 64 vars · 32 defs · call depth 32 · 16 KiB/string ·
1024 list/dict items · 256 KiB output (truncated with a note, never
silently cut). Large command output lands in `_`; `free _` or `gc`
releases it. If a script outgrows this, it is two scripts (`run` nests
4 deep: `sh "run part2.cybsh"`).

## Errors (house `prefix: detail` contract, prefix-first)

`syntax:` (with line number) · `not_found:` · `invalid:` ·
`too_large:` (budget hit) · `denied:` (capability refusal) · `fail:`
(raised) · `unsupported:` (needs dashboard/Pages — never faked) ·
`integrity:` (stale journal) · `conflict:` (from `edit`). Location
rides along as a suffix: `unknown command: 'x' (line 4)`.

## Minimal complete example

```python
# cybsh: 1
# cap: deny=rm read=/providers/inbox write=/archive
# schedule: nightly
# on: inbox
# /scripts/nightly.cybsh — tidy inbox, report, restyle

def note(text):
  return "[nightly] " + text

print note("start")

try:
  let pending = sh("ls /providers/inbox")
  if len(pending) == 0:
    print "inbox empty — nothing to file"
  else:
    print "filing:"
    print pending
    $ cp /providers/inbox/notes.txt /archive/notes.txt
catch e:
  print "triage skipped: " + e

print "durability:"
sh "scrub || echo scrub-unavailable-here"
sh "gc --dry || echo gc-unavailable-here"

# green accent = tidy run finished; errors above abort first.
sh "ui accent #34c759"
print note("done")
```

Long jobs (`sync start`, `ai ask`) are **detached** (`202` + poll) — start
them, then `sync status` / `ai status`; never block a script waiting.
