# Android on-device smoke test (CI, best-effort).
#
# Zero on-device verification was the gap: `apksigner verify` proves the
# signature, not that the app installs + boots. This script installs the
# built APK on a running emulator (if one is reachable) and:
#   1. `adb install` the APK (arm64 APK needs an arm64 emulator image;
#      x86_64 images cannot run it — that mismatch skips, not fails).
#   2. `adb shell am start` the main activity.
#   3. Checks the process is STILL ALIVE at 8s and 13s — the reported
#      "installs, instantly closes, shows nothing" symptom leaves no FATAL
#      marker (LMK/ANR kill), so a dead process IS the failure signal.
#   4. Greps a freshly-cleared logcat window for crash markers.
#
# Graceful skip (exit 0) when: no device/emulator attached, wrong ABI,
# missing platform-tools. CI wires this with `continue-on-error` so KVM-less
# runners stay green; the skip reason is always printed.
