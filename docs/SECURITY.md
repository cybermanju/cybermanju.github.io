# Security

Threat model, transport story, key management and operational hardening for
CyberManju OS. Owner: **AGENT-3** (`AGENT-3.md`).

---

## 1. Threat model

The product is a *decentralized PC*: a local library of files, identities and
encryption keys that also syncs ciphertext to third-party providers.

**Assets**

| Asset | Where it lives | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| File contents | Local disk (plain) + provider (encrypted) | The user's data |
| Encryption private keys | `encryption_keys` table, sealed at rest | Compromise = total loss |
| JWT signing secret | `CYBERMANJU_JWT_SECRET` / `<data dir>/jwt_secret` (0600) | Compromise = forged sessions |
| Master passphrase | `CYBERMANJU_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` / `<data dir>/master.passphrase` (0600) | Compromise = unseals keys at rest |
| Provider tokens | `sync_configs.token` + `<data dir>/oauth_credentials.enc` | Compromise = access to the user's cloud accounts |
| User password hashes | `users.password_hash` (Argon2id) | Compromise = offline cracking |

**Trust boundaries**

1. **Browser ↔ web server** — untrusted. The dashboard binds `127.0.0.1` by
   default; Docker binds `0.0.0.0` behind a proxy. Everything crossing this
   boundary is authenticated (JWT), role-checked, size-capped and
   rate-limited.
2. **App ↔ provider API** — semi-trusted. The app sends *ciphertext* only
   (AGENT-2 encrypts before upload; AGENT-3 seals private keys at rest), and
   the bearer token is the only thing a provider can correlate to an account.
3. **Process ↔ disk** — trusted at runtime, untrusted at rest. Anything
   persisted that is secret is either 0600 (JWT secret, master passphrase) or
   encrypted with an Argon2id-derived key (private keys, OAuth credentials).

**In scope / out of scope**

*In scope:* remote unauthenticated attacker against a published Docker
deployment; a malicious `Origin`; a malicious logged-in non-admin user; a
provider that is fully compromised; an attacker with read access to the data
directory but **not** the master passphrase.

*Out of scope:* an attacker with both the data directory and the master
passphrase (they own the machine); physical DMA/side-channel attacks; supply
chain compromise of a dependency; a malicious desktop user running as the
same OS account (the Tauri IPC surface is trusted by design).

---

## 2. Transport: there is no TLS

The API is a **hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 server** (`crates/web/src/lib.rs`) with no
TLS. That is acceptable for the default desktop binding (`127.0.0.1`) and is
**not** acceptable for the published Docker port.

Consequences:

* On localhost, `Authorization: Bearer …` never leaves the machine.
* On `0.0.0.0:3456` (Docker), every request — credentials, JWT, file bytes —
  crosses the network in cleartext, and the browser will also refuse to send
  `Secure` cookies / may downgrade mixed content.

**Never expose port 3456 directly to the internet.** Terminate TLS in front.

### 2.1 Caddy (recommended)

```caddyfile
drive.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3456

    header {
        Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
        X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
        Referrer-Policy "no-referrer"
        X-Frame-Options "DENY"
        Permissions-Policy "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()"
    }

    # Belt and braces: the app already sets a CSP, override only if you host
    # the SPA from a different origin.
}
```

Caddy obtains and renews a certificate automatically.

### 2.2 nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name drive.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/drive.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/drive.example.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer" always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;

    # The API accepts bodies up to 100 MB; keep nginx in step.
    client_max_body_size 100m;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3456;
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name drive.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

Set `CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://drive.example.com/api/sync/oauth/<provider>/callback`
when you terminate TLS at a proxy (see §5).

## 3. Authentication

### 3.1 Passwords

* Hash: **Argon2id**, parameters pinned to OWASP guidance —
  `m=19456 KiB, t=2, p=1`, 32-byte tag, random 16-byte salt
  (`crates/web/src/api/users.rs`).
* Verification rejects any hash that is not an `$argon2…` PHC string, so a
  substituted value can never be coerced into a different algorithm.
* **Legacy migration.** Older desktop builds stored an *unsalted* BLAKE3
  hex digest. Those hashes are accepted once, compared in constant time, and
  immediately rewritten as Argon2id — by both the HTTP and Tauri transports,
  which now share `api::users::authenticate`.

### 3.2 Sessions (JWT)

* HS256, 24 h expiry, `sub` / `user_id` / `role` / `iat` / `exp` / `jti`.
* The signing secret is resolved once, in this order:
  1. `CYBERMANJU_JWT_SECRET` — 64 hex chars are used raw, anything else is
     stretched with BLAKE3 to 32 bytes;
  2. `<data dir>/jwt_secret`, generated on first run with mode `0600`;
  3. a per-process random secret (only when no data directory can be
     resolved — **sessions then die on restart**).
* **Rotation:** delete `jwt_secret` (or set `CYBERMANJU_JWT_SECRET` to a new
  value) and restart. Every outstanding token is invalidated immediately.
* **Logout:** `POST /api/auth/logout` revokes the presented token's `jti` for
  the remainder of its lifetime. The denylist lives in memory, so a restart
  clears it — combined with rotation this covers every case.

### 3.3 Authorization

`security::required_role(method, segments)` is the route → role table; the
default is **Authenticated** (fail-closed).

| Requirement | Routes |
|---|---|
| Public | `GET /api`, `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/readyz`, `GET /api/metrics`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/users/login`, `POST /api/users/register`, `GET|POST /api/shared/*`, `GET /api/sync/oauth/{provider}/callback` |
| Admin | `POST /api/users`, `DELETE /api/users/{id}`, `POST /api/users/{id}/role`, `DELETE /api/trash`, `GET /api/share-links`, `DELETE /api/share-links/{id}`, `DELETE /api/sync/configs/{id}` |
| Authenticated | everything else |

Anything that fails authentication answers `401`; anything authenticated but
under-privileged answers `403`.

### 3.4 Registration and the first administrator

Open registration is **bootstrap-only**: it succeeds while the user table is
empty, or when an operator sets `CYBERMANJU_ALLOW_REGISTRATION=1`. The public
path can never mint an `admin`.

Because that would otherwise deadlock a headless deployment, Docker-style
installs provision the first administrator out of band:

```bash
CYBERMANJU_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
CYBERMANJU_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<long random password>
```

Both must be set; the account is created (or promoted/reset) at startup.
Remove the variables after the first successful login.

Desktop (Tauri) installs use the local IPC path, which is a trusted process
and may create administrators directly.

### 3.5 Brute force

* Per-IP fixed-window rate limiting: `100 req / 60 s`
  (`security::enforce_rate_limit`).
* Per-account login backoff: the 5th consecutive failure locks that username
  for 30 s, doubling per further failure up to 15 min. Lockout state is
  cleared by a successful login.
* Failed and successful logins both write an audit event.

## 4. Secrets at rest

| Secret | Protection |
|---|---|
| JWT secret | `0600` file / env |
| Master passphrase | `0600` file / env |
| Encryption private keys | Argon2id-derived key + ChaCha20Poly1305 (`sealed:v1:` prefix) |
| OAuth credentials | Argon2id-derived key + ChaCha20Poly1305, `0600` file |
| Provider tokens (`SyncConfig.token`) | never serialized to a client (`skip_serializing`) |
| User passwords | Argon2id |

Nothing secret is ever returned by an API response: `SyncConfig.token`,
`CloudAccount.token` and every `OAuthCredentials` secret field are
`skip_serializing`, and `/api/users` strips `passwordHash` before it leaves
the process.

**If the master passphrase is lost, sealed private keys and stored OAuth
credentials cannot be recovered.** Back up `<data dir>/master.passphrase`
with the same care you would back up a key file — and note that anything
stored *without* it (the passphrase file itself) is not a backup of the
wrapped keys.

### 4.1 Rotating the master passphrase

The keystore re-wraps on demand: set a new `CYBERMANJU_MASTER_PASSPHRASE`,
delete the affected `<data dir>/keystore.json` entry, and the next
`keystore::get_or_derive` call mints a fresh key. Sealed blobs encrypted
under the old passphrase (`seal:v1` payloads) are **not** re-encrypted
automatically — rotate by re-creating the keys, not by editing the file.

## 5. Provider OAuth

Flow: authorization code + **PKCE (S256)** for Google (Drive / Photos),
GitHub and GitLab.

1. `GET /api/sync/oauth/{provider}/start?configId=<id>` → `{ authorizeUrl, state }`.
   Requires a session. Fails with `400` when the client id/secret env vars
   are missing.
2. The client opens `authorizeUrl` in a browser.
3. The provider redirects to
   `GET /api/sync/oauth/{provider}/callback?code=…&state=…` — **Public**, the
   `state` parameter is the credential (it is single-use and expires after
   10 minutes).
4. The code is redeemed server-side with the PKCE verifier; the resulting
   `OAuthCredentials` are sealed at rest under `<data dir>/oauth_credentials.enc`.

### Redirect URI registration

Providers require an **exact** match. The default is:

```
http://127.0.0.1:3456/api/sync/oauth/<provider>/callback
```

Register exactly that in the provider console for a local install. For a
reverse-proxied deployment, set:

```bash
CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://drive.example.com/api/sync/oauth/github/callback
```

and register *that* value instead.

### Client credentials

```bash
CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=…
CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=…
CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=…
CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=…
CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=…
CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=…
```

They are read from the environment only — never stored in the database, and
never serialized to a client.

### What a provider can see

* The ciphertext of the files you upload (AGENT-2 encrypts before upload).
* Your account id, upload timestamps, file sizes and object names — encrypt
  before upload *and* keep names opaque if that metadata matters.
* **Nothing** about other files, your identity inside the app, or your
  encryption keys: private keys are sealed at rest and are never sent.

---

## 6. HTTP hardening

Implemented in `crates/web/src/security.rs`, wired into both the embedded
server and `docker/server`:

* **Request line / header caps** — 8 KiB request line, 8 KiB per header,
  100 headers, 4 KiB `Authorization`.
* **Body cap** — 100 MB, rejected with `413` *before* the body is read.
* **Connection cap** — 256 concurrent connections, then `503`.
* **Rate limit** — 100 requests / 60 s per IP, `429` on overflow.
* **CORS** — an explicit allowlist. Arbitrary `Origin` headers are **never**
  reflected; unlisted origins get no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` at all.
* **Security headers** on every response:
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`,
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(),
  geolocation=(), payment=()` and a CSP
  (`default-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`).
  HSTS is deliberately left to the TLS proxy.
* **Input validation** — usernames, display names, passwords, roles, ids and
  share tokens are validated centrally; `limit`/`offset` are clamped.

## 7. Environment variable reference

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CYBERMANJU_DATA_DIR` | Directory for every persisted secret |
| `CYBERMANJU_JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret (64 hex = used raw) |
| `CYBERMANJU_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase that unseals keys at rest |
| `CYBERMANJU_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `_PASSWORD` | Provision the first administrator |
| `CYBERMANJU_ALLOW_REGISTRATION` | `1` — allow registration once users exist |
| `CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | Override the OAuth callback URI |
| `CYBERMANJU_OAUTH_{GOOGLE,GITHUB,GITLAB}_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` | OAuth client credentials |
| `DB_PATH` | Location of the redb database (also locates the data dir) |
